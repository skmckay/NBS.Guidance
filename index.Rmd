What are nature-based solutions? Lots of formal definitions (e.g., [United Nations](https://www.naturebasedsolutionsinitiative.org/news/united-nations-environment-assembly-nature-based-solutions-definition/#:~:text=TheUNEA-5resolutionformally,effectivelyandadaptively%2Cwhilesimultaneously), [IUCN](https://inbs.iucn.org/))

What is guidance?

What is included on this site? Water resources.  

What's not included? Single papers. Only manuals.
